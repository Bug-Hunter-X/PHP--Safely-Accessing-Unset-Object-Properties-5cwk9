In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object properties that might not be set.  Directly accessing a property without checking for its existence can lead to unexpected behavior, particularly `E_NOTICE`-level warnings or even unexpected `NULL` values. This is different from languages with null-safe operators.

```php
class MyClass {
    public $name;
}

$obj = new MyClass();
echo $obj->name; // Notice: Undefined property: MyClass::$name in ...
```

This code will produce a warning because `$obj->name` is accessed without ensuring it's set.  The solution involves explicitly checking if the property exists before accessing it using `isset()` or `property_exists()`.
